<LandingHero>This commit introduces essential project dependencies such as Svelte Kit, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN-Svelte. It includes a visually engaging landing page with a hero image in the +page.svelte route of the application. The hero image, along with the h1, p, and Button components, is encapsulated within the LandingPage component.
